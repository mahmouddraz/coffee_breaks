# Coffee breaks
A simple idea and a simple colab code aims to maintain communication with colleagues who are not on your team while working from home: automated online coffee dates as an alternative to conversations at the coffee machine. 

# How to use it
* Open the notebook in your Colab account or run locally in Jupyter Notebook.
* Upload a list of employees with their names and emails.
* Enter the credentials of the email you want to send, then select "Run All" from the runtime menu.
